Look around using a third person free-look camera

Move around in an environment where the forward direction is determined by
the camera rotation

Tuned the movement

boxes to jump onto and invisible walls to prevent falling of

coins that rotate on top of boxes to collect

upon collection of the coins, they disappear, and update a score value in the
UI
